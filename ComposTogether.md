# ComposTogether

# Located at Constitution Park (Address: Fletcher Ave & Lewis Street, 2018 Fletcher Ave, Fort Lee, NJ 07024\)

# **OVERVIEW**

Every year, about 60 million tons of food garbage is produced by the United States, which is about 40% of the US food supply. This is a major problem because as food waste piles up in landfills, it produces greenhouse emissions equal to that of about 37 million cars and wastes up to a third of all water used in farms. 

Instead of throwing the food waste into the trash, composting could recreate them into something that is useful: fertilizer. Composting is a process where organic material, especially food waste, breaks down into a soil-like material named compost that is rich in nutrients and can be used as fertilizer. 

Many other places are already emplacing composting programs. For example, in South Korea, there is a nationwide program where citizens are required to throw out food waste into a separate bin that is sent to composting facilities. 

Through this program, volunteers would manage a composting bin, collect food waste, and create fertilizer that can be donated or sold in fundraisers. 

# **DETAILS**

1. The name of this community composting program is ComposTogether.   
1. We have three compost bins located in the community garden in Constitution Park.  
1. There are three teams that rotate on managing the composting bins each week. Thus, each volunteer would work once per three weeks.   
1. We will only accept fruit peelings and leftover vegetables (no dairy, meat, seafood, or cooked products).   
   1. There cannot be any stickers or inorganic material inputted into the compost bins.  
1. Some things that volunteers would have to do include:  
   1. Collecting food waste and putting it into the compost bin  
   1. Making sure only the correct food waste is being collected  
   1. Turning the compost bin  
   1. Making sure there is a good balance between food waste and “browns” (ex: dead leaves, wood chips, saw dust, etc)  
   1. Collecting the compost

# **Value**

We are living in a time where the Earth is suffering from environmental problems like greenhouse emissions, climate change, and global warming. Composting is one of many ways that would reduce pollution and has numerous benefits for the world. 

This program would help our community by decreasing the amount of food waste and creating fertilizers for gardens. By working on this program, we would start to grow an appreciation for the environment and learn more about the many ways that we could help the Earth. 

Although this may be just a pilot program for now, starting from this moment, it can grow into a full-fledged composting system for our town.
